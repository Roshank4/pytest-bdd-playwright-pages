# pytest-bdd-playwright-pages
An example repository using Pytest-BDD built on playwright using the page object model (without actually using the page object model classes)

This is a pytest-bdd project built using Playwright, and using pages to organize the code.

The screenshot has an example of the html report that is working.

If you want to run the code, use line 8 in the in the test_selenium_web_driver.py file (you need to be in the tests directory)

Dependencies:

pip install pytest
pip install pytest-bdd
pip install playwright
(If this doesn't work, follow these steps:

  pip install --upgrade pip
  pip install --upgrade setuptools
  pip install greenlet
  pip install playwright
)

pip install pytest-playwright
pip install pytest-html
